Check that:

A valid user switches the tool on
A vaild maintainer switches the tool on
A card that exists in the system but does not have perms does not switch the
tool on
A card that does not exist in the system does not switch the tool on

Check that card status changes correctly update the cache:

no perm -> perm
no perm -> maintainer
perm -> no perm
perm -> maintainer
maintainer -> no perm
maintainer -> perm

a maintainer can add a card
a maintainer can take an in service tool out of service (and is cached)
a maintainer can take an out of service tool in service (and is cached)
a normal user can take an in service tool out of service (and is cached)

check that cached users work when the acnode is disconnected
check that tool in service/out of service works when the acnode is disconnected

XXX what happend to tool status if we:

Are disconnected, a maintainer puts the tool out of service, the acnode is
reconnected and rebooted - it will query the server, the server will tell
the acnode that it should be in service and the acnode will put it back into service,
is that what we want?

Is the acnode or the acserver the authoritive source of the in/out of service status?

button colours:

tool starting up: yellow
tool in service, with net connection: blue
tool in service, no net connection: flashing orange/blue
tool out of service: red

Tool in service, and running: green
Tool in service, and running with a maintainer: yellow
Tool in service, card with no permissions: orange
tool in service, card not recognised: orange (would have to add more state
to recognise this case)

bugs:

clear does not work? (or maybe we need to re-read the settings?).
spams syslog if tool offline.
  - we need a "new user detected function"
the user stuff should be a class
new/delete, pointers and references, malloc and free is all a bit crazy.
