Check that:

A valid user switches the tool on
A vaild maintainer switches the tool on
A card that exists in the system but does not have perms does not switch the
tool on
A card that does not exist in the system does not switch the tool on

Check that card status changes correctly update the cache:

no perms -> perm
no perm -> maintainer
perm -> no perm
perm -> maintainer
maintainer -> perm
maintainer -> no perm

a maintainer can add a card
a maintainer can take an in service tool out of service (and is cached)
a maintainer can take an out of service tool in service (and is cached)
a normal user can take an in service tool out of service (and is cached)

check that cached users work when the acnode is disconnected
check that tool in service/out of service works when the acnode is disconnected

XXX what happend to tool status if we:

are disconnected, a maintainer puts the tool out of service, the acnode is
reconnected and rebooted - it will query the server, the server will tell
the acnode that it should be 

button colours:

tool starting up: yellow
tool in service, with net connection: blue
tool in service, no net connection: flashing orange/blue (?)
tool out of service: red

Tool in service, and running: green
Tool in service, and running with a maintainer: yellow
Tool in service, card with no permissions: orange
tool in service, card not recognised: orange (would have to add more state
to recognise this case)
